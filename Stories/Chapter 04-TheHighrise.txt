	 <p>
	    Welcome back to the meditation series that focuses on increasing the practitioners daily agility and influence.
		Today, we will be working with balancing violence and peace. As we have come to find, violence really is the Swizz-army knife of problem solving - and can function as strategic enabler for some really interesting new acquintences on the dance floor - but violence is not always the right tool. We will be exploring different ways to handle conflicts at the workplace, leaving you with a much broader portfolio of options on how to handle stressful situations in the real life.

	    Before we get into all of that though, make sure that you are situated in a place and position that you can maintain undisturbed for the remainder of this meditation. You can perform the mediation either seated or lying down. Both will do you good.
	 </p>
	 <p>
	    Close your eyes if you haven't done so already. We will do a short recap of the different breating techniques we have learned so far, starting with the drive-by/uzi-breathing technique.

	<spokenPart spokenBy="narrator" name="BreathingTechRecapShotgun">
	 <p>
	    Next up, the shotgun breathing technique. Remember, on my "draw", you get ready to pull the trigger, and on my "shoot", you shotgun gallons of fresh air into your lungs, with the intent to explode the walls of your rib-cage.

	<spokenPart spokenBy="narrator" name="BreathingTechRecapWhatWasThat">
	 <p>
	    Now, time for some "What was that?"-breathing. I will ask: "What was that?", and you will pretend to be the blind man playing hide-and-seek with his beautiful, flow-scent-smelling wife. Get ready.
		<break time="1000ms"/>
		What was that? <prosody rate="85%">1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10</prosody>
     </p>	 
    </spokenPart>


	<spokenPart spokenBy="narrator" name="BreathingTechRecapZen">
	 <p>
	   And finally, we are back to the Zen-breathing technique, and we will dwell a little more on this. Get ready.
       <break time="1000ms"/>
         Breathe in <prosody rate="65%">1, 2, 3, 4, 5 , 6</prosody>
	     Breathe out <prosody rate="65%">1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9</prosody>
       <break time="1500ms"/>
         Breathe in <prosody rate="65%">1, 2, 3, 4, 5 , 6</prosody>
	     Breathe out <prosody rate="65%">1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9</prosody>
       <break time="700ms"/>
	   
	   All very good. Now, I want you to continue breathing Zen, while we play a little game. Your objective is to keep a calm and steady heart-rate, while I through cheap insults at you.

	    We are back in the town, but this time, we have taken a stroll down to the center of the town, and the newly build high-rise, or sky-scraper if you will. I know what you are thinking, and nevermind the likelyhood of the local city-counsel approving the construction of a 70 storey high-rise in Inspector Barnabys peaceful - yet surprisingly murderous - countryside idyll. Context is everything for the sort of voyage we are on, and I need you in a highrise, and having you mentally re-create Manhattan carries too great a risk of something unforeseen - like you beating the crap out of a bunch of homeless people in the subway - happening.

	<spokenPart spokenBy="narrator" name="TheHighRise">
	 <p>
	    You lean back and look towards the top of the building. Have you ever wondered what it's like to be on top of the world? Have you ever wondered what it's like to be a CEO of multi-billion global PR company? Well, it's time to find out. But let's get you out of your dance-outfit and into something more fitting for a 10-minute sky-rocket carreer into the 0.1%. There you go; nice woollen business suit. You look shazzy.
     </p>	 
	 <p>
	    You enter the building, walk past the security guards towards the outside glass elevator, and press the button for the penthouse floor. Home to the renowned "S and G publicity" PR company.
     </p>
	 <p>
	    As the elevator shoots along the outside of the building, you ponder the amount of force it would take to break through the glass walls of the elevator and fall to your inevitable demise. But you don't know why this thought crossed your mind. But I know. And you will know too.
     </p>	 	
	 <p>
	 	   As the doors of the elevator open on the 70th floor, you are greated by a young man, who looks to be no older than 27.

	 <p>
	 	   That guy down there by the water fountain, that's Clayton. He's our boss. He is a real manly man. I don't know if you can tell from here, but he is 6 foot 8 (or 203,2 centimeters) and weighs at least 265 pounds. 
		   Let me give you a couple of pointers regarding Clayton.
     </p>
	 <p>
	 	   First thing: he does not respect weakness. If you don't assert yourself right off the bat, by this time tomorrow, he'll pretend like you don't work here or maybe give you a cute girls name like Lindsey or Lonnie. 
     </p>	 
	 <p>
	 	   Secondly: the guy seems to be stuck in the nineteen eighties and early nineteen nineties. If you can quote Miami Vice, Airwolf or some such garbage television show, you are practically a made man.
     </p>	 	 
	 <p>
	 	   Lastly: first impressions are everything with this guy. You have to make your first handshake with him count. Really squeeze that hand. Or, you know what might be even better? Do you remember that macho jump-up-and-bump-chests greeting? I've seen him do that one with his friends.
     </p>

	<spokenPart spokenBy="narrator" name="TheHighRise_GreetingTheBoss">
	 <p>
	 	   Based on the solid advice from Justin, you decide to risk it and go for the macho jump-up-and-bump-chests greeting. Seeing as your new boss outweighs you by at least 66 pounds - or 30 kilos - you pre-charge your legs by dipping slightly before massively exploding your whole body at a 45 degree angle directly at boss Clayton who, however, is all but prepared for your brave and manly greeting and is shot 4 feet - or roughly 120 centimeters - back, landing on his posterior.

	 	   You size Clayton up as he is getting to his feet again. He might be a big guy, but his movements show no sign of agility or explosiveness. He may have big thighs, but from the wobliness with which they bring his body to uprising, they appear more butter than rock.

	 	   Now, I know what you are thinking Killer, but I need you to contain yourself a little longer. As I said, violence is not the right tool for every situation, but we will explore that option in just a bit. But let's let the man finish his tirade.

	 	   Alright, before we move into agression, I need you to make a mental note of this here moment. Like a savepoint in a computer game, we will call this moment: "cross-roads". In honor of the U.S. Hip Hop Artist Eminem, we will call the path you are about to take, the "psycho-path".

	 	   You are back in your garden. Your happy place. Squared up against boss Clayton. It's time to unleash your rage, but before you do so, I have to advice you not to injure his face for the next part to work. 
     </p>
	 <p>
	 	   You kick the outside of his fat left right, and as expected, your shin cuts through it like a warm knife through melted butter, forcing the monstrocity to drop to one knee for a moment. 
           <break time="2000ms"/>
     </p>
	 <p>
	 	   As he gets up, he immediatly throws a hay-maker at you from his right hand, so telegraphed that even the jerks back at the corporate headquaters must have seen it coming. You nimbly avoid the punch by jumping to your left, before sawing his left thigh in halves with your right shin. The fat tree goes down. 
           <break time="2000ms"/>
     </p>	 
	 <p>
	 	   You shimmy around to his backside, and land a hard roundhouse kick to his right kidney, that sends him screaming to the ground. You bring out your hunters knife, and end the short struggle, but slitting his throat from behind, leaving the guy to bleed to death on the ground.

	       At first you are worried that she is going to notice the stitches on the skin of your new body from where you assembled the cut-off skin, making an effort to stay under the covers, but you pretty quickly realize that she has her eyes closed, and probably wouldn't even notice if you were to take off your new head, and you relax in the moment.

	       That was something new for you, wasn't it? Do you remember ever spending quality time with such an attractive woman before? But now that it's done, how do you feel? Do you feel like cuddling up next to her and telling her you love her? Or do you feel strangely empty inside? It's not like laying next to you girlfriend in your Happy Place, right? You might want to make a mental note of that. Or not. In any case, we have to get going for the morning meeting with the CEO and CCO of the company.

	 	   The CEO is berating the CCO for his lack of creativity in coming up with a fancy slogan for their new customer: the educational internet portal "Head waste learning and I.T.".

	 <p>
	 	   You are standing in your new CEO-office, looking out at the world at your feet, contemplating this new life of yours. You have the biggest house in town, drive the fastest car and have a smoking hot trophy wife, yet it all feels so... empty! You have stopped wearing Claytons skin, but nobody seems to have noticed. You feel like a giant bag of money, and nobody seems to pay any attention to what is on the outside of the bag. All they care about, is how you represent the next step in their own climb towards the top of the world. 
     </p>	 	 
	 <p>
	 	   Take a couple of deep breaths in, and feel how thin the air is at these altitudes, devoid of substance and human contact.

	 <p>
	 	   You are back at the checkpoint, with Clayton screaming increasingly more vulgar profanities at you, demanding that you explain your peculiar behaviour.

	 <p>
	 	As you slow-dance with your girlfriend, you pull her close and enjoy the smell of her hair, feeling that special kind of warmth that you have only felt in her arms. The kind of warmth that was so far away up there, on top of the world.      
        <break time="5000ms"/>
     </p>
	 <p>
	 	I am glad you've gained some perspective in life, and now it's time for you to take your new perspective out into the real world, and find the same kind of warmth out there.
		We will be back in your mental wonderland next weak, when a storm is brewing in the outskirts of paradise. Until then: go get 'em Killer.
